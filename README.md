Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing various data science projects I've completed. Here you'll find details about the following projects:

## 1. Iris Flower Classification

**Description:** This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to classify iris flowers into different species based on their petal and sepal measurements. The goal is to explore and implement various classification algorithms to accurately predict the species of iris flowers.

## 2. Unemployment Analysis

**Description:** In this project, I analyze unemployment data to gain insights into trends, patterns, and factors influencing unemployment rates. I explore data visualization techniques and statistical analysis to provide a comprehensive understanding of unemployment dynamics.

## 3. Car Price Prediction

**Description:** This project is all about predicting the prices of used cars. I employ regression models to predict car prices based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, and more. The aim is to create an accurate pricing model that can assist both buyers and sellers.

## 4. Email Spam Detection

**Description:** Email spam is a prevalent issue, and in this project, I've developed a machine learning model for email spam detection. The model is trained on a dataset containing both spam and non-spam (ham) emails, and it can effectively classify incoming emails as spam or not.

Feel free to explore the individual project folders for more details, code, and documentation. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy coding!
